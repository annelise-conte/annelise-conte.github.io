**Teaching Portfolio Site (Annelise Conte)**

A simple portfolio created as an example of a pre-service Technology teacher completing the unit COMP208. It is built with **semantic HTML**, and **external CSS (starter.css)**. This portfolio is designed to showcase my teaching, projects, and resources I have collated with clean structure, design and accessibility in mind. It has been deployed with **GitHub Pages**.

**Pages:** Home, About, Teaching Practice, Project Showcase (card layout), Samples of Work (card layout), Resume, Resources, Contact, Contact Me. 

**Goals:** Clean structure, unique and consistent design, accessible typography/colour, and beginner-friendly CSS patterns.

**Live**: https://annelise-conte.github.io/

**Tech**

- HTML5 + CSS3 (external stylesheet: starter.css)

- Vanilla JavaScript (light enhancement: image toggle, buttons)

- GitHub Pages for hosting

**Colour & Contrast checked with Adobe Color Contrast Checker**

- AAA normal text: ≥ 7:1

_Notes_
- Contrast ratios between colours were verified using Adobe Color Contrast Checker against theme colours in starter.css.
- If colours are changed in starter.css, re-check ratios on Adobe Color Contrast Checker to keep accessibility compliance.
