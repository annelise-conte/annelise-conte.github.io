**Teaching Portfolio Site (Annelise Conte)**

A professional portfolio created as an example of a pre-service Technology teacher completing the unit COMP208. It is built with **semantic HTML**, and **external CSS (starter.css)**. This portfolio is designed to showcase my teaching, projects, and resources I have collated with clean structure, design and accessibility in mind. It has been deployed with **GitHub Pages**.

**Pages:** Home, About, Teaching Philosophy, Reflections (card layout), Samples of Work (card layout), Resume, Resources (with Javascript Tool), Contact Me (with Javascript Tool). 

**Goals:** Clean structure, unique and consistent design, accessible typography/colour, and beginner-friendly CSS patterns, integration of interactive JavaScript components. 

**Live**: https://annelise-conte.github.io/

**Tech**

- HTML5 + CSS3 (external stylesheet: starter.css)

- Vanilla JavaScript (grade converter and contact form validation)

- GitHub Pages for hosting

- Hyperspace by HTML5 Up as base theme.
