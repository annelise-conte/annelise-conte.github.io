					<h1> My Teaching Philosophy</h1>
					<p>I am currently in my fourth and final year of a double degree of Bachelor of Education (Secondary) and Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation and Technologies) at Australian Catholic University. Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in a wide range of teaching strategies, particularly in the areas of food technology. My journey has deepened my understanding of curriculum development, student engagement, and innovative teaching practices tailored to 21st-century learners.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Alongside my studies, I work in a high school setting where I teach Technology Mandatory and Food Technology to students from Years 7 to 12. This hands-on experience has further fuelled my passion for education and solidified my desire to specialise in this teaching area. I am deeply committed to helping students grow both academically and personally, and I find great fulfilment in creating supportive, inclusive learning environments where all students can thrive. My passion for teaching stems from a genuine desire to make a positive impact on young people's lives through meaningful and practical learning experiences.</p>

                    <h2>Practicum Placement Overview</h2>
                    <p>Throughout my university teaching degree, I have completed a variety of practicum placement opportunities that have allowed me to develop skills in teaching and apply theoretical knowledge in real classrooms. I have gained valuable experience from across a range of different school contexts and have provided an overview below of these including the name, subjects taught, year levels and term completed.</p>
